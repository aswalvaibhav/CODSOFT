üíª CODSOFT: My Data Science & Machine Learning Internship Projects

Welcome to my repository for the CODSOFT Data Science & Machine Learning Internship! This collection showcases my completed projects, where I've applied my practical skills in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.

‚ú® About CODSOFT

CODSOFT offers a comprehensive virtual internship program that provides hands-on experience in various tech domains. This internship was a fantastic opportunity to work on real-world projects and apply my knowledge in a practical setting.

üéØ My Projects

Here is a detailed look at the exciting projects I developed during this internship. Each project is located in its own dedicated folder.

Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python üé¨

Objective: The primary goal of this project was to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the IMDb rating of a movie based on its features.

Methodology:

- Data Exploration and Preprocessing: I started with a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure, identify relationships between variables, and handle missing values. I also performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the data was in the right format for the model.

- Feature Engineering: I created new, insightful features to enhance the model's predictive power. This included transforming categorical data and creating aggregate features.

- Model Building: I trained a Linear Regression model to predict the movie ratings.

Key Findings: The model identified key factors influencing a movie's rating, such as the genre, director, and lead actors. The analysis provided a solid foundation for predicting a film's potential critical success.

Task 4: Sales Prediction Using Python üìä 

Objective: This project aimed to create a robust model for predicting future sales based on advertising spending across different channels.

Methodology:

- Data Analysis: I performed a deep dive into the provided advertising dataset, analyzing the impact of spending on TV, radio, and newspaper advertisements on overall sales.

- Model Building: I implemented a Linear Regression model to forecast sales. This model helped quantify the relationship between advertising budget and sales revenue.

- Visualization: I created a variety of plots and charts to visualize the data and the model's predictions, making the insights accessible and easy to understand.

Key Findings: The analysis revealed which advertising channels had the most significant impact on sales. The model's predictions provide a data-driven basis for optimizing future marketing budgets.

Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection üí≥ 

Objective: The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model that could effectively detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

Methodology:

- Handling Imbalanced Data: A key challenge was the heavily imbalanced dataset, where fraudulent transactions were a tiny fraction of the total. I addressed this using appropriate techniques to ensure the model didn't simply predict all transactions as legitimate.

- Model Building: I trained a Logistic Regression model to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

- Evaluation: I used metrics like accuracy, precision, and a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance, focusing on its ability to correctly identify fraud without excessive false positives.

Key Findings: The model successfully identified patterns that signal fraudulent activity, providing a powerful tool for financial institutions to prevent losses.

üöÄ How to Run the Projects
